Welcome to the 49th issue of the Rust GameDev Workgroup's
monthly newsletter.
[Rust] is a systems language pursuing the trifecta:
safety, concurrency, and speed.
These goals are well-aligned with game development.
We hope to build an inviting ecosystem for anyone wishing
to use Rust in their development process!

[Graviton - The Great Sand Simulator](https://www.gravitongame.art/)
([Discord](https://discord.gg/3MyPaDagsd),
[Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_O90KyEt8o)) by
[@hakolao](https://github.com/hakolao/)
is a falling sand simulator in which you can define your own interactive
sand rules.

Continuing the developer's exploration into GPU sand simulation
the app has been recently taken to another level with a complete rewrite.
Now, with some [training](https://docs.gravitongame.art/Tutorial),
you can program your own rules for the sand.
Many example sands are provided from acid and blood to the classic
Game of Life.

Recent updates include:
- Customizable sand with programmable rules
- [Shape & Mirror Draw Modes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cOPy4Shqn8U)
- New UI, graphics and render modes
- Gif and Image export
- Image import

You can support the development by purchasing or wishlisting on
[steam](http://s.team/a/2137280). Join [Discord](https://discord.gg/3MyPaDagsd)
and follow [@hakolao on youtube](https://www.youtube.com/@Okko1990) to
stay up do date with the development.
